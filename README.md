# CatGPT
A textual and programmatic generation experiment in testing the limitations of ChatGPT 4o mini. And also just to make a silly joke a reality.

This process took fifteen iterations, most of which were focused on correcting issues with the commas. ChatGPT just couldn't seem to get this corrected easily. My prompts probably weren't helping.
